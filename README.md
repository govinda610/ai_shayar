# 🌟 AI_Shayar: Your Personal AI Ghalib 🤖📝

Welcome to **AI_Shayar**, a whimsical venture into the world of poetry, inspired by the legendary Urdu poet, Mirza Ghalib. While we might affectionately call it a "stupid AI Ghalib" for now, this project is designed to harness the beauty of ghazals and shayari, transforming them into a fine-tuned AI model capable of generating heartfelt verses.

## ✨ What is AI_Shayar?

AI_Shayar is a framework that pulls together ghazals, poetry, and kavita from the vast expanse of the internet. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, it fine-tunes a large language model—specifically the Gemma 2 9B model—using Alpaca and Unsloth via the LoRA/QLoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) framework.

Imagine having a poetic companion that can craft verses as beautifully as Ghalib himself, responding to your emotions and thoughts with elegance and depth. This project aims to bridge the gap between technology and the timeless art of poetry.
